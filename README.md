# HeroicBashLauncher

Ever wanted to launch your Epic Games Store games installed through [Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher) directly from the terminal, Lutris, Steam or any other frontend game launcher? 
Heroic Bash Launcher lets you do this very easily. 

You can now launch your game directly without having to open Heroic at all. There's no need to run `heroic` to find the game's launch command or write your own launch script with [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary)! Thus saving your time!

## Pre-requisites
- Heroic Games Launcher 1.10 'Kizaru'
- Python 3
- Git


## Working

Heroic Bash Launcher automatically detects installed games and creates a launch file for each game. The launch file is created using the *bash shell script*, i.e. `.sh` files. For example, if I have Rocket League installed, it will create the launch file titled "Sugar.sh".


All these launch files will be available in the **GameFiles** folder. 


**For now, all launch files will be titled according to how legendary names the games (AppName.sh). The game's actual name will be mentioned in the launch file, as seen below.**

Every game's launch file will contain all the launch parameters according to the game's setting in Heroic Games Launcher, including cloud syncing for supported games. Here's an example below of "Sugar.sh" -

```
#!/bin/bash

#Game Name = Rocket LeagueÂ®

cd .. && ./HeroicBashLauncher.sh #Overrides launch parameters

Running game in offline mode..." && PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH=1 WINEESYNC=1 MANGOHUD=1 /usr/bin/gamemoderun /opt/Heroic/resources/app.asar.unpacked/build/bin/linux/legendary launch Sugar --offline --wine '/home/redromnon/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/lutris-ge-6.21-1-x86_64/bin/wine64' --wine-prefix '/home/redromnon/.wine' )
